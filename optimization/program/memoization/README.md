# Memoization

Memoization used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. (Src: [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization));

Example of using it with [fluent-interface](https://github.com/ned4ded/snippets/tree/master/patterns/fluent-interface) and [lazy-initialization](https://github.com/ned4ded/snippets/tree/master/patterns/lazy-initialization) patterns is [hereby](./combo/fluent-interface.js);
